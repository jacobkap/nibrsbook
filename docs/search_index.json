UCR data is, with the exception of the more detailed data that only covers murders, a monthly number of crimes or arrests reported to a single police agency which is then gathered by the FBI into one file that includes all reporting agencies. It is actually a collection of different datasets, all of which have information about crimes and arrests that occur in a particular jurisdiction. Think of your home town. This data will tell you how many crimes were reported for a small number of crime categories or how many people (broken down by age, sex, and race) were arrested for a (larger) set of crime categories in that city (if the city has multiple police agencies then each agency will report crimes/arrests under their jurisdiction though the largest agency - usually the local police department - will cover the vast majority of crimes/arrests in that city) in a given month. This is a very broad measure of crime, and its uses in research - or uses for understanding crime at all - is fairly limited. Yet is has become over much of the last century - and will likely remain among researchers for at least the next decade - the most important crime data in the United States.1 UCR data is important for three reasons: The definitions are standard, and all agencies (tend to) follow them so you can compare across agencies and over time.2 The data is available since 1960 (for most of the datasets) so there is a long period of available data.3 The data is available for most of the 18,000 police agencies in the United States so you can compare across agencies. More than many other datasets, there will be times when using UCR data that youll think thats weird. This book will cover this weirdness and when we think the weirdness is just an odd - but acceptable - quirk of the data, and when it is a sign of a big problem in the data or in that particular variable and that we should avoid using it. For most of this book well be discussing the caveats of the above reasons - or, more directly, why these assumptions are wrong - but these are the reasons why the data is so influential. 1.1 Goal of the book By the end of each chapter you should have a firm grasp on the dataset that is covered and how to use it properly. However, this book cant possibly cover every potential use case for the data so make sure to carefully examine the data yourself for your own particular use. I get a lot of emails from people asking questions about this data so my own goal is to create a single place that answers as many questions as I can about the data. Again, this is among the most commonly used crime datasets and there are still many current papers published with incorrect information about the data (including such simple aspects like what geographic unit data is in and what time unit it is in). So hopefully this book will decrease the number of misconceptions about this data, increasing overall research quality. Since manuals are boring, Ill try to include graphs and images to try to alleviate the boredom. That said, I dont think its possible to make it too fun so sorry in advanced. This book is a mix of facts about the data, such as how many years are available, and my opinions about it, such as whether it is reliable. In cases of facts Ill just say a statement - e.g. the offenses data is available since 1960. In cases of opinion Ill temper the statement by saying something like in my opinion or I think. 1.2 Structure of the book This book will be divided into nine chapters: this chapter, an intro chapter briefly summarizing each dataset and going over overall issues with UCR data, and seven chapters each covering one of the seven UCR datasets. Each chapter will follow the same format: well start with a brief summary of the data such as when it first because available and how it can be used. Next well look at how many agencies report their data to this dataset, often looking at how to measure this reporting rate a couple of different ways. Finally, well cover the important variables included in the data and how to use them properly (including not using them at all) - this will be the bulk of each chapter. 1.3 Citing this book If this data was useful in your research, please cite it. To cite this book, please use the below citation: Kaplan J (2021). National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS) Data: A Practitioners Guide. https://nibrsbook.com/. BibTeX format: @Manual{ucrbook, title = {National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS) Data: A Practitioner&#39;s Guide}, author = {{Jacob Kaplan}}, year = {2021}, url = {https://nibrsbook.com/}, } 1.4 Pronunciation This data is usually just called NIBRS, and generally theres no distinction between segment files since they all (other than the window files) work in unison as they are pieces of the overall criminal incident. NIBRS is generally pronounced as NIE-BERS. It rhymes with HIGH-BERS. Ive also heard it pronounced - usually by non-academics - using a soft i like in timber so it sounds like nih-bers. I prefer the NIE-BERS saying but it really doesnt make a difference. 1.5 Sources of NIBRS data There are a few different sources of UCR data available today. First, and probably most commonly used, is the data put together by the National Archive of Criminal Justice Data (NACJD)). This a team out of the University of Michigan who manages a huge number of criminal justice datasets and makes them available to the public. If you have any questions about crime data - UCR or other crime data - I highly recommend you reach out to them for answers. They have a collection of data and excellent documentation available for UCR data available on their site here. One limitation to their data, however, is that each year of data is available as an individual file meaning that youll need to concatenate each year together into a single file. Some years also have different column names (generally minor changes like spelling robbery rob one year and robb the next) which requires more work to standardize before you could concatenate. They also only have data through 2016 which means that the most recent years (UCR data is available through 2019) of data are (as of this writing) unavailable. Next, and most usable for the general public - but limited for researchers - is the FBIs official website Crime Data Explorer. On this site you can chose an agency and see annual crime data (remember, UCR data is monthly so this isnt as detailed as it can be) for certain crimes (and not even all the crimes actually available in the data). This is okay for the general public but only provides a fraction of the data available in the actual data so is really not good for researchers. Finally, I have my own collection of UCR data available publicly on openICPSR, a site which allows people to submit their data for public access. For each of these datasets Ive taken the raw data from the FBI (for early years of homicide data this is actually from NACJD since the FBIs raw data is wrong and cant be parsed. For later years of homicide data this is from the FBIs raw data.) and read it into R. Since the data is only available from the FBI as fixed-width ASCII files, I created a setup file (well explain exactly how reading in this kind of data works in the next chapter) and read the data and then very lightly cleaned the data (i.e. only removing extreme outliers like an agency having millions of arsons in a month). For each of these datasets I detail what Ive done to the data and briefly summarize the data (i.e. a very short version of this book) on the datas page on openICPSR. The main advantage is that all my data has standard variable names and column names and, for data that is small enough, provide the data as a single file that has all years. For large datasets like the arrest data I break it down into parts of the data and not all years in a single file. The downside is that I dont provide documentation other than whats on the openICPSR page and only provide data in R and Stata format. I also have a similar site to the FBIs Crime Data Explorer but with more variables available - that site is available here. Its worth mentioning a final source of UCR information. This is the annual Crimes in the United States report released by the FBI each year around the start of October.4 As an example, here is the website for the 2019 report. In this report is summarized data which in most cases estimates missing data and provides information about national and subnational (though rarely city-level) crime data. As with the FBIs site, it is only a fraction of the true data available so is not a very useful source of crime data for quality research. Still, this is a very common source of information used by researchers. 1.5.1 Where to find the data used in this book The data I am using in this book is the cleaned and concatenated data that I put together from the raw data that the FBI releases. That data is available on the data hosting site openICPSR here. I am hosting this book through GitHub which has a maximum file size allowed that is far smaller than these data, so youll need to go to openICPSR to download the data; its not available through this books GitHub repo. 1.6 Recommended reading While this book is designed to help researchers use this data, the FBI has an excellent manual on this data designed to help police agencies submit their data. That manual, called the Summary Reporting System (SRS) User Manual provides excellent definitions and examples of many variables included in the data. In this book when I quote the FBI, such as defining a crime, I quote from this manual. The manual is available to download as a PDF on the FBIs site and Ive also posted it on my GitHub page in case the FBI ever take down the PDF.5 The link on my GitHub page is here. I highly recommend that you read this manual before using the data. That manual, alongside this book which tries to explain when and how the agencies dont follow the manual, will provide a solid foundation for your understanding of UCR data. The FBI has said they will no longer accept UCR data after 2020, instead only accepting the more detailed National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS) data. However, only about half of agencies reported NIBRS data in 2019 and this number decreases steadily for earlier years. This means that UCR data has the longevity that NIBRS doesnt have, as most agencies have reported for decades, and will still be useful even though the data becomes increasingly outdated. Well see many examples of when agencies do not follow the definitions, which really limits this data. While the original UCR data first reported in 1929, there is only machine-readable data since 1960. They also release a report about the first 6-months of the most recent year of data before the October release but this is generally an estimate from a sample of agencies so is far less useful. This is far more likely to happen as a result of standard government changing a site and forgetting to update the link rather than intentionally making the manual unavailable.

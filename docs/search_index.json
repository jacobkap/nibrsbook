We take the number of crimes reported to the police and divide it by the number of people living in the United States that year. For example, there were about 16,000 murders in 2019 and 328 million people in the county - 16,000 / 328 million = ~1/20,500. Youll more commonly see this - in news articles, in political speeches, in research articles, on TV, etc. - reported as the rate per 100,000 people but thats just a matter of conversion, the numbers are the same. This is, however, totally wrong. It assumes - and lets now just pretend that theres no underreporting of crimes to the police - that every single person has the exact same risk of victimization. We know this is wrong intuitively. There are the bad parts of town or people who run with the wrong crowd. Research in criminology backs this up by finding that crime is generally concentrated among a small group of people and within a small geographic area (usually a very small number of streets or neighborhoods in a city). From surveys that ask if people have been victims of a crime we also know that victimization rates differ by age, race, gender, income, and city type. Indeed, think of a personal characteristic (e.g. risk tolerance, athleticism, frequency outdoors) and there will probably be large differences in the likelihood of being a victim within these groups. So why do people so frequently talk about crime as rates per total population? Why assume that everyone has equal risk of being a victim? The major reason, I think, is that the main FBI dataset on crime, the Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) System Data doesnt provide any information about crime victims other than for homicide and hate crime victims.2 Victimization surveys are nearly all at state or national levels so trying to use their results for specific city-level rates will have very high levels of imprecision, likely enough to make the results unhelpful. So by necessity people tend to assume equal risk since theres not good data to do so otherwise. Doing so, however, is a large mistake in my opinion. It both overstates and understates risk, often very drastically. For example, many murders are concentrated among young minority men in impoverished areas of urban cities. Their risk of being murdered is many times higher than youd expect from simply dividing murders by city population overall. And the risk for other people in the city is far smaller than youd expect from the naive risk value. While UCR data is the predominant dataset in criminology and the one that truly guides Americas perceptions of crime, there is actually one that is far more detailed and allows us do a much better (though far from perfect) measure of crime victimization by a number of victim traits. This dataset, called the National Incident-Based Reporting System - and often called by its abbreviation NIBRS - provides demographics information about each victim of crime. Like the UCR this is a dataset from the FBI which standardizes information from agencies in the United States so it is comparable across agencies and over time (with some caveats). This data includes the age, race, gender, and the relationship of the victim to the offender for every known victim. We also have info about the offense such as which crimes occurred (and unlike the UCR, incidents can have multiple offenses), where and when it occurred, and what weapons (if any) we used. And we have demographic information about offenders, and whether they were arrested (including the type of arrest such as warrant arrest). From this we can figure out victimization rates based on certain victim characteristics, though not all of them that we may think are important. Of course, the research opportunities from this highly detailed data extend far beyond mere victimization rates. Personally Ive used the data to examine topics ranging from marijuana decriminalization and domestic violence injuries to daylight saving times effect on crime clearance. As of this writing in early summer 2021, Google Scholar has over 1,500 results for NIBRS research since 2017. As the FBI has said that starting in 2021 NIBRS data will completely replace UCR data, this is crime dataset of the future (though I believe that UCR will still be heavily used for many years to come). For graduate students and early career researchers, this is likely the dataset that youll use for your entire career. 1.1 Goal of the book By the end of the book you should have a firm grasp on NIBRS data and how to use it (or as is occasionally the case, choose not to use it) properly. However, this book cant possibly cover every potential use case for the data so make sure to carefully examine the data yourself for your own particular use. I get a lot of emails from people asking questions about this data so my own goal is to create a single place that answers as many questions as I can about the data.3 As the FBI has moved to only use NIBRS data starting in 2021, I expect the uses of this data - and thus the number of emails I get - to grow very quickly. This is an increasingly popular dataset used by criminologists (and by other fields studying crime) and yet there are still occasions where papers are using the data incorrectly.4 So hopefully this book will decrease the number of misconceptions about this data, increasing overall research quality. Since manuals are boring, Ill try to include graphs and images to try to alleviate the boredom. That said, I dont think its possible to make it too fun so sorry in advanced. This book is a mix of facts about the data, such as how many years are available, and my opinions about it, such as whether it is reliable. In cases of facts Ill just say a statement - e.g. NIBRS data began in 1991. In cases of opinion Ill temper the statement by saying something like in my opinion or I think. 1.2 Structure of the book This book will be divided into nine chapters: this chapter, an intro chapter briefly summarizing each segment files and going over overall issues with NIBRS data, and seven chapters each covering one of the seven UCR datasets. Each chapter will follow the same format: well start with a brief summary of the data such as its possible uses and pitfalls. And then, well cover the important variables included in the data and how to use them properly (including when to not use them at all) - this will be the bulk of each chapter. 1.3 Citing this book If this data was useful in your research, please cite it.

NIBRS is generally pronounced as NIE-BERS. It rhymes with HIGH-BERS. Ive also heard it pronounced - usually by non-academics - using a soft i like in timber so it sounds like nih-bers. I prefer the NIE-BERS saying but it really doesnt make a difference. 1.5 Sources of NIBRS data There are a few different sources of UCR data available today. First, and probably most commonly used, is the data put together by the National Archive of Criminal Justice Data (NACJD)). This a team out of the University of Michigan who manages a huge number of criminal justice datasets and makes them available to the public. If you have any questions about crime data - NIBRS or other crime data - I highly recommend you reach out to them for answers. They have a collection of data and excellent documentation available for UCR data available on their site here. Theyve also put together what they call Extract Files which are where they merged some of the NIBRS segments together, saving you the effort of doing so yourself. These extract files essentially take every potential unit of analysis - incident, victim, offender, and arrestee (some crimes have no victims, only arrestees) - and merge it with the segment which has info about the incident such as the time of day or the outcome, and information about the reporting agency. This source only has data through 2016 which means that the most recent years (NIBRS data is available through 2019) of data are (as of this writing) unavailable. Next, and most usable for the general public - but limited for researchers - is the FBIs official website Crime Data Explorer. On this site you can chose an agency and see annual crime data (NIBRS data is at the day-level so this is very aggregated data) for certain crimes (and not even all the crimes actually available in the data). This site has only a small subset of the available data and is already aggregated so youre dealing with a subset of data in a unit of analysis that you may not want. For example, this site lets you see the annual age of offenders for certain crimes in age brackets such as aged 20-29. As the data provides the exact age (in years) of each offender, this is much less useful than the full data. The crimes on this site are also limited to only the eight Index Crimes (Murder, rape, robbery, aggravated assault, arson, burglary, theft, and motor vehicle theft) so are only a tiny share of the crimes actually reported in NIBRS data. For more on what Index Crimes are, please see here. This data source is potentially okay for the general public but only provides a fraction of the data available in the actual data so is really not good for researchers. Finally, I have my own collection of UCR data available publicly on openICPSR, a site which allows people to submit their data for public access. For each of these datasets Ive taken the raw data from the FBI and read it into R. Since the data is only available from the FBI as fixed-width ASCII files, I created a setup file (well explain exactly how reading in this kind of data works in the next chapter) and read the data into R and saved the files in R and Stata files for easy use. The main advantage is that all my data has standard variable names and column names and can be read into modern programming languages R and Stata (this is also true of recent NACJD years, but early years come as fixed-width ASCII files). The downside is that I dont provide documentation other than whats on the openICPSR page and only provide data in R and Stata format so people using languages such as SAS or SPSS cannot use this data.5 1.5.1 Where to find the data used in this book The data I am using in this book is the cleaned and concatenated data that I put together from the raw data that the FBI releases. The raw data that the FBI releases is available here. The data that I have released is available on the data hosting site openICPSR here. I am hosting this book through GitHub which has a maximum file size allowed that is far smaller than these data, so youll need to go to openICPSR to download the data; its not available through this books GitHub repo. 1.6 Recommended reading While this book is designed to help researchers use this data, the FBI has an excellent manual on this data designed to help police agencies submit their data. That manual, called the 2019 National Incident-Based Reporting System User Manual provides excellent definitions and examples of many variables included in the data. In this book when I quote the FBI, such as defining a crime, I quote from this manual. The manual is available to download as a PDF on the FBIs site and Ive also posted it on my GitHub page in case the FBI ever takes down the PDF.6 The link on my GitHub page is here. I highly recommend that you read this manual before using the data. That manual, alongside this book which tries to explain when and how the agencies dont follow the manual, will provide a solid foundation for your understanding of NIBRS data. 1.7 How to contribute to this book If you have any questions, suggestions, or find any issues, please email me at jkkaplan6 [@] gmail.com. For more minor issues like typos or grammar mistakes, you can edit the book directly through its GitHub page. Thatll make an update for me to accept, which will change the book to include your edit. To do that, click the edit button at the top of the site - the button is highlighted in the below figure. You will need to make a GitHub account to make edits. When you click on that button youll be taken to a page that looks like a Word Doc where you can make edits. Make any edits you want and then scroll to the bottom of the page. There you can write a short (please, no more than a sentence or two) description of what youve done and then submit the changes for me to review. Figure 1.1: The edit button for how to make edits of this book. This is according to data from the FBIs 2019 Crime in the United States report. There is a small amount of information available for property theft victims, but not enough to do these kinds of victimization rate calculations Writing also keeps away the boredom. Though given that the data is fairly complicated and requires good programming knowledge, the bar is higher to use it. So there are far fewer bad uses of this data than there is for UCR data. I am not sure if SAS or SPSS can read in R or Stata data files. This is far more likely to happen as a result of standard government changing a site and forgetting to update the link rather than intentionally making the manual unavailable.

This data, the Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program Data, is a monthly count of the number of crime incidents (in cases where more than one crime happens per incident, only the most serious crime is included) in each police agency that reports data.7 Other than for homicides, only the number of crimes that occurred is included. So we know, for example, the number of robberies in a city but nothing about who the victims or offenders were, when that month (day or time of day) the robberies occurred, or the type of location where they happened. To address these limitations the FBI started a new dataset in 1991, the National Incident-Based Reporting System data, which is known by its abbreviation NIBRS, and is the topic of this book. NIBRS data provides detailed information on every crime reported to the police, including victim and offender demographics, whether the offender was arrested (and type of arrest or type of exceptional clearance), the crime date and hour, victim-offender relationship, and the crime location (as a location type, not the exact address). It also covers a far wider range of crimes than UCR data did. With the exception of UCR data on assaults against police officers, all NIBRS data can be converted back to UCR data, making it fully backwards compatible - and, therefore, comparable to UCR data. In many ways NIBRS data is a massive improvement to UCR data. We now have a far deeper understanding of crime and this has led to an explosion of research that allows a far more detailed analysis of crime and crime-policies than the blunt UCR data. However, this is a major limitation to this data: most agencies dont use it. According to the FBI only about 8,500 police agencies, covering about 45% of the US population, reported NIBRS data in 2019 (the latest year currently available), fewer than half of the about 18,000 police agenices in the United States. This is an even larger problem that it seems are the agencies that do report - especially in earlier years of the data - are disproportionately small and rural. So were missing out of data from major cities. A number of states dont have any agencies reporting, making this data relatively biased at least in terms of geography and city size. Even so, the FBI has said that they are moving entirely to NIBRS data starting in 2021, and will no longer even collect UCR data. While NIBRS can be converted to UCR data, meaning we can have consistent statistics over time, for agencies that dont report to NIBRS, we have no information on their crimes. In effect, unless the majority of agencies suddenly switch to NIBRS - which, given the high level of detail relative to UCR data is a costly and timely switch - we will be flying blind for most crime in the country. So there are really three major problems with NIBRS data, both related to the lack of reporting. First, we are potentially looking at a massive loss of data when UCR data ends in 2020 - it takes over a year for data to be released so even though Im writing this is Spring 2021, 2019 UCR and NIBRS data are the latest years available. Especially given the huge crime changes during 2020 - and whose violent crime increases and continuing into 2021 - losing standardized crime data for most cities is a very bad thing. The second problem is that even if suddenly all agencies do start reporting in 2021, wed only have a single year of data available. Even for agencies that already report, we generally dont have too many years of data for them. This really limits the kind of research since we can do since its hard to know if a finding is based on a trend or is just a weird outlier without having many years of data available. This means that for the next several years at least well be mostly using NIBRS data as UCR-like datasets, aggregated to the month- or year-level so we can compare it with UCR data from the past. Luckily, this problem will be alleviated the longer we wait as more years of data will become available. The final issue is that this data is massive. A single year of 2019 data, with &lt;50% of agencies, and few large agencies, reporting has about 6.5 million crime incidents recorded. Since each crime incident can have multiple victims, offenders, and crimes, there are more rows for these datasets. Once all agencies report - though its doubtful thatll ever occur - were looking at tens of millions of rows per year. And even now if we wanted to look at a decade of data were going to be dealing with over 50 million rows of data. So this data requires both good hardware - a strong laptop or server is necessary - and good programming skills, which most academics sorely lack. While people generally refer to NIBRS just as NIBRS data it is actually a collection multiple different datasets all corresponding to a single crime incident. For example, if you care about victim info youll look in the victim file called the Victim Segment (each of the datasets are called Segments since they are part of the whole picture of the crime incident) and likely will merge it with other data, such as when are where the crime occurred which is in the Offense Segment. In most cases youll merge together multiple datasets from the NIBRS collection to be able to answer the question that you have. This means that youll need to understand how to deal with multiple datasets, and subset and merge them as needed. Relative to the FBIs UCR data there are far fewer weird things in NIBRS data. Still, well cover instances of the weirdness in the data, such as the why crime always goes up on the 1st of the month, or why there are more crimes at noon than at nearly all other hours of the day. Well also be discussing how much of the detailed information that should be available in the data is missing, and when that affects which questions we can answer. A word of caution. To date fewer than half of agencies report NIBRS data. As they rush to comply with the FBIs order that they only will accept NIBRS data, there will likely be more mistakes made and erroneous data included in NIBRS data later than is covered in this book, which ends with 2019 data as 2019 is the most recent year available. So while I always urge caution when using any data - caution that should be accompanied by a thorough examination of your data before using it - NIBRS data from 2020 and beyond merits extra attention. 2.1 NIBRS gives you choices (which means you need to think) A major benefit of UCR data is that you have very limited choices. If you wanted to measure crime you only choice was to use their monthly aggregated city-level data. This makes working with the data relatively easy, even though what work you could do was limited. NIBRS data takes an opposite approach. It provides detailed data and largely leaves it up to the users for what to do with it. This flexibility is also a curse. 2.1.1 Choosing a unit of analysis Consider, for example, that you want to measure rape in a city. Even if we somehow solve the issue of victims not reporting their rapes, we still have a few different ways of even measuring rape. Lets use an incident where four men rape a single woman as an example. If youre interested in measuring robbery you could do so in several different ways, each of which addresses a different part of crime measurement and will lead to different answers to your questions: the number of crime incidents, the number of victims, the number of offenders, and the number of crimes. First, we can follow the old UCR measure of incident-level and say that this is one rape since only one crime incident occurred (even though there were multiple offenders). Second, we could look at the victim-level, which again is one rape as there was only one victim. Or at the offender-level, which now has four rapes since each offender would be responsible the robbery. Finally we could look at the offense-level. This data actually makes it unclear what act each offender actually committed so wed likely measure it as one offense per offender in each incident.8 2.2 Crimes included in NIBRS 2.2.1 Group A crimes Aggravated Assault All Other Larceny Animal Cruelty Arson Assisting Or Promoting Prostitution Betting/Wagering Bribery Burglary/Breaking And Entering Counterfeiting/Forgery Credit Card/ATM Fraud Destruction/Damage/Vandalism of Property Drug Equipment Violations Drug/Narcotic Violations Embezzlement Extortion/Blackmail False Pretenses/Swindle/Confidence Game Fondling (Incident Liberties/Child Molest) Gambling Equipment Violations Hacking/Computer Invasion Human Trafficking - Commercial Sex Acts Human Trafficking - Involuntary Servitude Identity Theft Impersonation Incest Intimidation Justifiable Homicide Kidnapping/Abduction Motor Vehicle Theft Murder/Non-negligent Manslaughter Negligent Manslaughter Operating/Promoting/Assisting Gambling Pocket-Picking Pornography/Obscene Material Prostitution Purchasing Prostitution Purse-Snatching Rape Robbery Sexual Assault With An Object Shoplifting Simple Assault Sodomy Sports Tampering Statutory Rape Stolen Property Offenses (Receiving, Selling, Etc.)

Besides NIBRS being more complicated to use, far fewer agencies report NIBRS data than do UCR data. Nearly all agencies report crime data for UCR, though fewer do so for some of the UCR datasets such as arrests or arsons - for more, please see my UCR book. In comparison, fewer than half of agencies report to NIBRS, and these agencies are disproportionately smaller and more rural. Starting with 2021 data, the FBI has stopped collecting UCR data, instead only collecting NIBRS data. So if - and this is a very large if - agencies move to NIBRS in 2021, well start having much more detail from a very representative sample of agencies.9. Even so, most research - especially policy analyses - requires many years of data so itll take many years before the full potential of NIBRS data can be realized, assuming most agencies report data starting in 2021. Well look here at how many agencies report at least one crime between 1991 - the first year of data - and 2019 - the latest year of data - as well as compare NIBRS reporting to UCR reporting. Figure 2.1 shows the number of agencies each year that reported at least one incident. Keep in mind that there are about 18,000 police agencies in the United States. Only a little over 600 agencies reporting in 1991. This has grown pretty linearly, adding a few hundred agencies each year though that trend accelerated in recent years. In 2019, nearly 8,200 agencies reported at least some data to NIBRS. Compared to the estimated 18,000 police agencies in the united States, however, this is This is an overcount, however, this constitutes relatively low participation among agencies. And, as agencies may report for part of the year meaning that we actually have fewer fully reporting agencies that this graph applies. Figure 2.1: The annual number of agencies reporting at least one incident in that year. Another way to look at reporting is comparing it to reporting to UCR. Figure 2.2 shows the number of agencies in each state that report NIBRS data in 2019. Since 2019 is the year with the most participation, this does overstate reporting for previous years. This map pretty closely follows a population map of the US. Texas had the most agencies, followed by Michigan and Ohio. The southern states have more agencies reporting than the lightly populated northern states. The issue here is that a number of states are in white, indicating that very few agencies reported. Indeed, four four of the most populated states - California, New York, Florida, and New Jersey - dont have any agencies at all that report NIBRS data. Figure 2.2: The number of agencies in each state that reported at least one crime in 2019 to NIBRS. Since the number of agencies in a state is partially just a factor of population, Figure 2.3 shows each state as a percent of agencies in that state that report to NIBRS that also reported to the UCR Offenses Known and Clearances by Arrest (the crime dataset) in 2019. Not all agencies in the US reported to UCR in 2019 - and a small number reported to NIBRS but not UCR in 2019 - but this is a fairly good measure of reporting rates. Here the story looks a bit different than in the previous figure. Now we can tell that among north-western states and states along the Appalachian mountains, nearly all agencies report. In total, 18 states have 90% or more of agencies that reported to UCR in 2019 also reporting to NIBRS. Thirteen agencies have fewer than 10% of agencies reporting to NIBRS that also reported to UCR, with 5 of these having 0% of agencies reporting. The remaining states average about 56% of agencies reporting. So when using NIBRS data, keep in mind that you have very good coverage of certain states, and very poor coverage of other states. And the low - or no - reporting states are systematically high population states. Figure 2.3: Agencies in each state reporting at least one crime to NIBRS in 2019 as a percent of agencies that reported UCR Offenses Known and Clearances by Arrests data in 2019. For ease of reference, Table 2.4 shows the number of agencies in each state reporting to NIBRs and to UCR in 2019, and the percent shown in Figure 2.3. If youre reading this on your phone or computer you can search or sort the table. Figure 2.4: The number of agencies in each state reporting to NIBRS and to UCR in 2019. Also shows NIBRS reporting in each state as a percent of UCR reporting. 2.6 How to identify a particular agency (ORI codes) In the UCR and other FBI data sets, agencies are identified using ORiginating Agency Identifiers or an ORI. An ORI is a unique ID code used to identify an agency.10 If we used the agencys name wed end up with some duplicates since there can be multiple agencies in the country (and in a state, those this is very rare) with the same name. For example, if you looked for the Philadelphia Police Department using the agency name, youd find both the Philadelphia Police Department in Pennsylvania and the one in Mississippi. Each ORI is a 9-digit value starting with the state abbreviation (for some reason the FBI incorrectly puts the abbreviation for Nebraska as NB instead of NE) followed by 7 numbers. In the UCR data (another FBI data set) the ORI uses only a 7-digit code - with only the 5 numbers following the state abbreviation instead of 7. So the NIBRS ORI codes are sometimes called ORI9. For nearly all agencies, the only difference between the UCR ORI and the NIBRS ORI is that the NIBRS ORI has 00 at the end so it is technically 9 characters long but isnt any more specific than the 7-character UCR ORI code. When dealing with specific agencies, make sure to use the ORI rather than the agency name to avoid any mistakes. For an easy way to find the ORI number of an agency, use this page on my site. Type an agency name or an ORI code into the search section and it will return everything that is a match. 2.7 The data as you get it from the FBI Well finish this overview of the NIBRS data by briefly talking about format of the data that is released by the FBI, before the processing done by myself or NACJD that converts the data to a type that software like R or Stata or Excel can understand. The FBI releases their data as fixed-width ASCII files which are basically just an Excel file but with all of the columns squished together. As an example, Figure 2.5 shows what the data looks like as you receive it from the FBI for the Offenses Known and Clearances by Arrest dataset for 1960, the first year with data available. In the figure, it seems like there are multiple rows but thats just because the software that I opened the file in isnt wide enough - in reality what is shown is a single row that is extremely wide because there are over 1,500 columns in this data. If you scroll down enough youll see the next row, but that isnt shown in the current image. What is shown is a single row with a ton of columns all pushed up next to each other. Since all of the columns are squished together (the gaps are just blank spaces because the value there is a space, but that doesnt mean there is a in the data. Spaces are possible values in the data and are meaningful), you need some way to figure out which parts of the data belong in which column. Figure 2.5: Fixed-width ASCII file for the 1991 National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS) dataset. The fixed-width part of the file type is how this works (the ASCII part basically means its a text file). Each row is the same width - literally the same number of characters, including blank spaces. So you must tell the software you are using to process this file - by literally writing code in something called a setup file but is basically just instructions for whatever software you use (R, SPSS, Stata, SAS can all do this) - which characters are certain columns. For example, in this data the first character says which type of UCR data it is (1 means the Offenses Known and Clearances by Arrest data) and the next two characters (in the setup file written as 2-3 since it is characters 2 through 3 [inclusive]) are the state number (01 is the state code for Alabama). So we can read this row as the first column indicating it is an Offenses Known data, the second column indicating that it is for the state of Alabama, and so on for each of the remaining columns. To read in this data youll need a setup file that covers every column in the data (some software, like R, can handle just reading in the specific columns you want and dont need to include every column in the setup file). The second important thing to know about reading in a fixed-width ASCII file is something called a value label.11 For example, in the above image we saw the characters 2-3 is the state and in the row we have the value 01 which means that the state is Alabama. Since this type of data is trying to be as small as efficient as possible, it often replaces longer values with shorter one and provides a translation for the software to use to convert it to the proper value when reading it. Alabama is more characters than 01 so it saves space to say 01 and just replace that with Alabama later on. So 01 would be the value and Alabama would be the label that it changes to once read. Fixed-width ASCII files may seem awful to you reading it today, and it is awful to use. But it appears to be an efficient way to store data back many decades ago when data releases began but now is extremely inefficient - in terms of speed, file size, ease of use - compared to modern software so Im not sure why they still release data in this format. But they do, and even the more modern (if starting in 1991, before I was born, is modern!) NIBRS data comes in this format. For you, however, the important part to understand is not how exactly to read this type of data, but to understand that people who made this data publicly available (such as myself and the team at NACJD) must make this conversion process.12 This conversion process, from fixed-width ASCII to a useful format is the most dangerous step taken in using this data - and one that is nearly entirely unseen by researchers. Every line of code you write (or, for SPSS users, click you make) invites the possibility of making a mistake.13 The FBI does not provide a setup file with the fixed-width ASCII data so to read in this data you need to make it yourself. Since some UCR data are massive, this involves assigning the column width for thousands of columns and the value labels for hundreds of different value labels.14 A typo anywhere could have potentially far-reaching consequences, so this is a crucial weak point in the data cleaning process - and one in which I have not seen anything written about before. While I have been diligent in checking the setup files and my code to seek out any issues - and I know that NACJD has a robust checking process for their own work - that doesnt mean our work is perfect.15 Even with perfection in processing the raw data to useful files, decisions we make (e.g. what level to aggregate to, what is an outlier) can affect both what type of questions you can ask when using this data, and how well you can answer them. This data has been expanded since it began in 1929 to include information on arrests, hate crimes, and stolen property. For more on this, please see my book Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program Data: A Practitioners Guide at ucrbook.com. For four people involved in a rape, do we care if all four actually committed the crime? Does it matter if only three committed the rape and one merely stood by? I say representative sample as certainly not all agencies will report, even once UCR is no longer collected. Itll take time for all agencies to report, and I doubt well ever get to 100% of agencies. I will refer to this an ORI, ORI code, and ORI number, all of which mean the same thing. For most fixed-width ASCII files there are also missing values where itll have placeholder value such as -8 and the setup file will instruct the software to convert that to NA. UCR data, however, does not have this and does not indicate when values are missing in this manner. For those interested in reading in this type of data, please see my R package asciiSetupReader. Even highly experienced programmers who are doing something like can make mistakes. For example, if you type out 2+2 100 times - something extremely simple that anyone can do - how often will you mistype a character and get a wrong result? Id guess that at least once youd make a mistake. With the exception of the arrest data and some value label changes in hate crimes and homicide data, the setup files remain consistent so a single file will work for all years for a given dataset. You do not need to make a setup file for each year. For evidence of this, please see any of the openICPSR pages for my detail as they detail changes Ive made in the data such as decisions on what level to aggregate to and mistakes that I made and later found and fixed. "],["administrative-and-window-exceptional-clearance-segment.html", "Chapter 3 Administrative and Window Exceptional Clearance Segment 3.1 Important variables", " Chapter 3 Administrative and Window Exceptional Clearance Segment The Administrative Segment provides information about the incident itself, such as how many victims or offenders there were. In practice this means that it tells us how many other segments - offense, victim, offender, and arrestee segments - there are for this particular incident. It also has several important variables at the incident-level such as what hour of the day the incident occurred and whether the incident date variable is actually just the date the incident was reported. Finally, it tells us whether the case was cleared exceptionally and, if so, what type of exceptional clearance it was. This can tell us, for example, how many crimes was cleared because the offender died or the victim refused to cooperate. As the UCR data doesnt differentiate between normal clearances (i.e. arrest the offender) and exceptional clearances, this provides a far deeper understanding of case outcomes. 3.1 Important variables 3.1.1 The incident report date Figure 3.1: The percent of crimes that occur (the day of the incident, even if the crime wasnt reported that day) each day of the month for all agencies reporting to NIBRS in 2019. Figure 3.2: The percent of crimes that are reported (the day of the report, even if not the day of the incident) each day of the month for all agencies reporting to NIBRS in 2019. 3.1.2 Hour of incident An extremely important aspect of crime data is when exactly the crime occurs. If, for example, crime always spikes when the local high school ends their day that would likely indicate that high school students are involved with crime (both as victims-offenders). In my own research on daylight saving time-crime I only care about the sunset hours, which is when daylight saving time would affect outdoor lighting. When crime happens also would affect police behavior as theyd likely increase patrol during times of elevated crime. Luckily NIBRS data does have the time of each incident, though its only at the hour level.

"],["offender-segment.html", "Chapter 5 Offender Segment 5.1 Important variables", " Chapter 5 Offender Segment As might be expected, the Offender Segment provides information about who the offender is for each incident, though this is limited to only demographic variables. So we know the age, sex, and race of each offender but nothing else. This means that important variables such as criminal history, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and motive are missing. In the Victim Segment we learn about the relationship between the victim and offender, and in the Offense Segment we learn which weapon (if any) the offender used. So there is some other data on the offender in other segments but its quite limited. This data has one row per offender so incidents with multiple offenders have multiple rows. In cases where there is no information about the offender there will be a single row where all of the offender variables will be unknown. In these cases having a single row for the offender is merely a placeholder and doesnt necessarily mean that there was only one offender for that incident. 5.1 Important variables 5.1.1 Demographics 5.1.1.1 Age Figure 5.1: The age of all offenders reported in the 2019 NIBRS data.

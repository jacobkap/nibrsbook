<h1><span class="header-section-number">Chapter 2</span> Overview of the Data</h1>
<p>Nearly a century ago the FBI started collecting data on crime that occurred in the United States as a way to better understand and respond to crime. This data, the Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program Data, is a monthly count of the number of crime incidents (in cases where more than one crime happens per incident, only the most serious crime is included) in each police agency that reports data.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> Other than for homicides, only the number of crimes that occurred is included. So we know, for example, the number of robberies in a city but nothing about who the victims or offenders were, when that month (day or time of day) the robberies occurred, or the type of location where they happened. To address these limitations the FBI started a new dataset in 1991, the National Incident-Based Reporting System data, which is known by its abbreviation NIBRS, and is the topic of this book.</p>
<p>NIBRS data provides detailed information on every crime reported to the police, including victim and offender demographics, whether the offender was arrested (and type of arrest or type of “exceptional clearance”), the crime date and hour, victim-offender relationship, and the crime location (as a location type, not the exact address). It also covers a far wider range of crimes than UCR data did. With the exception of UCR data on assaults against police officers, all NIBRS data can be converted back to UCR data, making it fully backwards compatible - and, therefore, comparable to UCR data. In many ways NIBRS data is a massive improvement to UCR data. We now have a far deeper understanding of crime and this has led to an explosion of research that allows a far more detailed analysis of crime and crime-policies than the blunt UCR data.</p>
<p>However, this is a major limitation to this data: most agencies don’t use it. <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/news/pressrel/press-releases/fbi-releases-2019-nibrs-crime-data">According to the FBI</a> only about 8,500 police agencies, covering about 45% of the US population, reported NIBRS data in 2019 (the latest year currently available), fewer than half of the about 18,000 police agenices in the United States. This is an even larger problem that it seems are the agencies that do report - especially in earlier years of the data - are disproportionately small and rural. So we’re missing out of data from major cities. A number of states don’t have any agencies reporting, making this data relatively biased at least in terms of geography and city size. <strong>Even so, the FBI has said that they are moving entirely to NIBRS data starting in 2021, and will no longer even collect UCR data.</strong> While NIBRS can be converted to UCR data, meaning we can have consistent statistics over time, for agencies that don’t report to NIBRS, we have no information on their crimes. In effect, unless the majority of agencies suddenly switch to NIBRS - which, given the high level of detail relative to UCR data is a costly and timely switch - we will be flying blind for most crime in the country.</p>
<p>So there are really three major problems with NIBRS data, both related to the lack of reporting. First, we are potentially looking at a massive loss of data when UCR data ends in 2020 - it takes over a year for data to be released so even though I’m writing this is Spring 2021, 2019 UCR and NIBRS data are the latest years available. Especially given the huge crime changes during 2020 - and whose violent crime increases and continuing into 2021 - losing standardized crime data for most cities is a very bad thing. The second problem is that even if suddenly all agencies do start reporting in 2021, we’d only have a single year of data available. Even for agencies that already report, we generally don’t have too many years of data for them. This really limits the kind of research since we can do since it’s hard to know if a finding is based on a trend or is just a weird outlier without having many years of data available. This means that for the next several years at least we’ll be mostly using NIBRS data as UCR-like datasets, aggregated to the month- or year-level so we can compare it with UCR data from the past. Luckily, this problem will be alleviated the longer we wait as more years of data will become available.</p>
<p>The final issue is that this data is massive. A single year of 2019 data, with &lt;50% of agencies reporting, and few large agencies, reporting has about 6.5 million crime incidents recorded. Since each crime incident can have multiple victims, offenders, and crimes, there are more rows for these datasets. Once all agencies report - though it’s doubtful that’ll ever occur - we’re looking at tens of millions of rows per year. And even now if we wanted to look at a decade of data we’re going to be dealing with over 50 million rows of data. So this data requires both good hardware - a strong laptop or server is necessary - and good programming skills, which most academics sorely lack. If you can, buy more RAM for your computer as that’s much easier than having to write complicated code to deal with large data.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>While people generally refer to NIBRS just as “NIBRS data” it is actually a collection multiple different datasets all - with a few exceptions - corresponding to a single crime incident. For example, if you care about victim info you’ll look in the victim file called the “Victim Segment” (each of the datasets are called “Segments” since they are part of the whole picture of the crime incident) and likely will merge it with other data, such as when are where the crime occurred which is in the “Offense Segment.” In most cases you’ll merge together multiple datasets from the NIBRS collection to be able to answer the question that you have. This means that you’ll need to understand how to deal with multiple datasets, and subset and merge them as needed.</p>
<p>Relative to the FBI’s UCR data there are far fewer “weird things” in NIBRS data. Still, we’ll cover instances of the “weirdness” in the data, such as the why crime always goes up on the 1st of the month, or why there are more crimes at noon than at nearly all other hours of the day. We’ll also be discussing how much of the detailed information that should be available in the data is missing, and when that affects which questions we can answer.</p>
<p>A word of caution. To date fewer than half of agencies report NIBRS data. As they rush to comply with the FBI’s order that they only will accept NIBRS data, there will likely be more mistakes made and erroneous data included in NIBRS data later than is covered in this book, which ends with 2019 data as 2019 is the most recent year available. So while I always urge caution when using any data - caution that should be accompanied by a thorough examination of your data before using it - NIBRS data from 2020 and beyond merits extra attention.</p>
<div id="choosing-a-unit-of-analysis" class="section level3" number="2.0.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.0.1</span> Choosing a unit of analysis</h3>
<p>A major benefit of UCR data is that you have very limited choices. If you wanted to measure crime you only choice was to use their monthly aggregated city-level data. This makes working with the data relatively easy, even though what work you could do was limited. NIBRS data takes an opposite approach. It provides detailed data and largely leaves it up to the users for what to do with it. This flexibility is also a curse. For every use of this data you will need to decide which unit of analysis to use - and NIBRS provides a few options.</p>
<p>Consider, for example, that you want to measure rape in a city. Even if we somehow solve the issue of victims not reporting their rapes, we still have a few different ways of even measuring rape. Let’s use an incident where four men rape a single woman as an example. If you’re interested in measuring robbery you could do so in several different ways, each of which addresses a different part of crime measurement and will lead to different answers to your questions: the number of crime incidents, the number of victims, the number of offenders, and the number of crimes. First, we can follow the old UCR measure of incident-level and say that this is one rape since only one crime incident occurred (even though there were multiple offenders). Second, we could look at the victim-level, which again is one rape as there was only one victim. Or at the offender-level, which now has four rapes since each offender would be responsible the robbery. Finally we could look at the offense-level. This data actually makes it unclear what act each offender actually committed so we’d likely measure it as one offense per offender in each incident.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>Since this data includes multiple crimes in each criminal incident, unlike the UCR which includes only the most serious crime per incident, we can also measure crime in its relationship to other crimes. In the above example we’re interested in rapes. The UCR method would measure it as the number of rapes in incidents where rape is the most serious charge (“most serious” is based on the FBI’s hierarchy of offenses, following what they call the Hierarchy Rule) but this understand crimes where rape happened alongside another, more serious, offense. So we can also look at incidents where any offense that occurred was a rape. Using this method we can examine how often rape - or any crime we’re interested in - co-occurs with other offenses, which provides more information on how crime happens that looking at one crime alone. In most cases, however, only one offense occurs per criminal incident, so the opportunity to explore co-occurrence is relatively limited.</p>

<div id="differences-from-ucr-data" class="section level2" number="2.2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Differences from UCR data</h2>
<p>While NIBRS data is a far more expansive and detailed dataset than the UCR data, in most cases you can convert NIBRS to UCR which allows for continuation of data over time. So the switch from UCR to NIBRS adds a lot of information but loses relatively little. That relatively little amount of difference, however, can impact the types of questions we can ask so they are detailed below.</p>
<div id="nibrs-does-not-have-unfounded-crimes" class="section level3" number="2.2.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.2.1</span> NIBRS does not have unfounded crimes</h3>
<p>In UCR data, which provides monthly counts of crimes (as well as more detailed info on hate crimes and homicides, and monthly counts of arrests), there is a count of “unfounded” crimes in each month. An unfounded crime is just one which was previously reported and then new evidence finds out that it never actually occurred (or that it isn’t for the crime that was reported). For example, if you misplace your wallet but think it is stolen you may call the police and report it stolen. This would be recorded in UCR data as a theft. If you then find your wallet and tell the police, then it would be changed to an unfounded crime since the reported theft never actually happened. NIBRS data does not include unfounded data at all so you don’t know how many reported crimes turn out to not be true. In practice, this doesn’t matter too much as unfounded crimes are very, constituting generally under 2% of each crime type. The major exception is in rape, where some agencies report that over 10% of rapes in certain years are unfounded. For more on this issue with rape, please see this section of my UCR book <a href="https://ucrbook.com/offensesKnown.html#unfounded-crimes">here</a>.
Given that UCR data already has major issue with rape data, including both changes in the definition of rape in 2013 and evidence that the number of cleared rapes is greatly exaggerated (see <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/when-it-comes-to-rape-just-because-a-case-is-cleared-does-not-mean-solved">here</a> for more info on this), losing unfounded rapes means losing a not insignificant number of likely real rapes.</p>
<p>Unfounded crimes are also a way that the UCR used to identify justifiable homicides and when police killed someone. But that way was not always used properly and NIBRS data already includes justifiable homicide as a crime category so this isn’t a problem.</p>
<div id="nibrs-does-not-have-negative-numbers" class="section level4" number="2.2.1.1">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">2.2.1.1</span> NIBRS does not have negative numbers</h4>
<p>Negative numbers in UCR data are because when a crime is reported and then later unfounded, in the month that it is unfounded it is classified as -1 crimes. This is so over the long term (i.e. more than a single month) the positive (but incorrect, and therefore unfounded) reports and the negative reports to deal with unfounding would equal out so you have the actual number of crimes. In practice though this tended to end up confusing users - though only users who didn’t read the manual. Since NIBRS does not have unfounded data, and since it isn’t aggregated beyond the incident-level anyways, there are no negative numbers in NIBRS data.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="less-information-on-assaults-against-officers" class="section level3" number="2.2.2">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.2.2</span> Less information on assaults against officers</h3>
<p>One of the UCR datasets, the <a href="https://ucrbook.com/leoka.html">Law Enforcement Officers Killed and Assaulted (LEOKA)</a> has monthly information on the number of police officers killed and assaulted for each reporting agency. For officers killed it only tells us how many officers were killed “feloniously” which basically means they were murdered or killed accidentally, such as in a car crash. While still only monthly counts, the info on assaults is far more detailed. It includes, for example, the type of call the officer was on during the assault (e.g. responding to a robbery, transporting a prisoner), the hour it occurred, what weapon the offender used, and whether the officer was injured. The data also included information on how many people were employee the agency as of Halloween of that year, with breakdowns by if that employee is a sworn officer or not, and by the gender of the employee. NIBRS data keeps some of this info. We know if the victim of a crime is a police officer, what injuries they sustained, and any weapon the offender was using. We don’t have any info on the call type the officer was on or information about the number of employees in that department with the same breakdown as in LEOKA. So, assuming that agencies that reported data to LEOKA report at the same rate in NIBRS, we’d still be losing information about assaults on police officers. The FBI has said that they’re retiring UCR data after 2020, and LEOKA is one of the UCR datasets so assumably this dataset would also be retired, leaving just NIBRS for information on crimes against police officers.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="a-summary-of-each-segment-file" class="section level2" number="2.3">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.3</span> A summary of each segment file</h2>
<p>NIBRS data is often discussed - and is used - as if it was a single file with all of this information available. But it comes as multiple different files that each provide different information about a criminal incident, including at different levels of analysis so users must clean each segment before merging them together. In this section we’ll discuss each of the segments and how they are related to each other. First, keep in mind that NIBRS is at its core an incident-level dataset (hence the “Incident-Based” part of its name). Everything that we have stems from the incident, even though we can get more detailed and look at, for example, individual victims in an incident or even offenses within an incident. Figure <a href="overview-of-the-data.html#fig:segmentFlowchart">2.1</a> shows the seven segments and how they relate to each other.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a>. There are also three segments called “window segments” - there is one for arrestees, one of exceptional clearances, and one for property - that do not have an associated segment with them, they only have the information available in the given window segment. We’ll talk about window segments more at the end of this section.</p>
<p>The first two boxes in Figure <a href="overview-of-the-data.html#fig:segmentFlowchart">2.1</a>, colored in orange, are not part of NIBRS but are part of the data generating process. First, obviously, a crime has to occur. The police then have to learn about the crime. This can happen in two ways. First, they can discover it themselves while on patrol. This is common in crimes such as drug possession or sale as well as any crime that occurs outdoors which is largely where police are able to observe behavior. The second way is that the victim or witness to a crime reports it. So if they call the police to report a crime, the police learn about it from that call. Alongside being report (or discovered) to the police, agencies must then report the crime to NIBRS. All crimes that occur in that agency’s jurisdiction <em>should</em> be reported, but that’s not always the case. Since reporting is voluntary (at least nationally, though some states do require agencies to report data), agencies are free to report as many or as few crimes as they wish. This often occurs when agencies report only parts of the year, excluding certain months, so you should ensure that the agency reported data for each month you’re interested in.</p>
<p>Once a crime occurs and is reported to the police, it can be recorded to NIBRS in two ways, depending on the type of crime that occurred. If it is one of the Group B crimes, then we only get a Group B Arrestee Segment which is the same as the normal arrestee segment which we discuss in more detail below as well as in Chapter <a href="arrestee.html#arrestee">7</a>. In this segment we have useful variables including the type of arrest (e.g. arrested by a warrant), what crime was committed, demographics of the arrestee, and weapon use. However, we’re missing a wealth of information that is available in the other segments. When the crime is one of the Group A crimes, we get all of this additional information.</p>
<p>For Group A crimes, we get every other segment, starting with the Administrative Segment. The Administrative Segment is largely a meta-segment - it provides information about other segments. The Administrative Segment is the only incident-level segment of the collection and provides information that is consistent across every offense in the incident such as the incident date and time (in hours of the day). It also includes the type of exceptional clearance for the incident, if the incident was exceptionally cleared. The key part of this segment, however, is that it tells you how many of the Offense, Offender, Victim, and Property segments that are associated with this incident. There are always at least one of these segments per incident, but can potentially be multiple of each segment. These other segments do exactly what their name suggests, providing information about the offenses, offender, victims, and stolen or damaged property for each crime incident.</p>
<p>At the bottom is the Arrestee Segment which is only available when a person was arrested for that incident. This provides a bit more detailed data than the Offender Segment for everyone who was arrested for the incident. Now, in reality arrestees aren’t necessarily a subset of offenders as some people arrestee may not be the ones included in the offender data. Consider, for example a crime where police initially think two people committed it but end up arresting three people for the crime. The third person would be in the arrestee file but not the offender file. However, in this data there is never a case where there are more arrestees than offenders so it appears that if an offender is arrested who wasn’t previously known to the police, they add a corresponding offender segment row for that arrestee.</p>

<div id="administrative-segment" class="section level3" number="2.3.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.3.1</span> Administrative Segment</h3>
<p>The Administrative Segment provides information about the incident itself, such as how many victims or offenders there were. In practice this means that it tells us how many other segments - offense, victim, offender, and arrestee segments - there are for this particular incident. It also has several important variables at the incident-level such as what hour of the day the incident occurred and whether the incident date variable is actually just the date the incident was reported. Finally, it tells us whether the case was cleared exceptionally and, if so, what type of exceptional clearance it was. This can tell us, for example, how many crimes was cleared because the offender died or the victim refused to cooperate. As the UCR data doesn’t differentiate between normal clearances (i.e. arrest the offender) and exceptional clearances, this provides a far deeper understanding of case outcomes.</p>

<div id="offender-segment" class="section level3" number="2.3.3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.3.3</span> Offender Segment</h3>
<p>As might be expected, the Offender Segment provides information about who the offender is for each incident, though this is limited to only demographic variables. So we know the age, sex, and race of each offender but nothing else. This means that important variables such as criminal history, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and motive are missing. In the Victim Segment we learn about the relationship between the victim and offender, and in the Offense Segment we learn which weapon (if any) the offender used. So there is some other data on the offender in other segments but it’s quite limited. This data has one row per offender so incidents with multiple offenders have multiple rows. In cases where there is no information about the offender there will be a single row where all of the offender variables will be “unknown.” In these cases having a single row for the offender is merely a placeholder and doesn’t necessarily mean that there was only one offender for that incident. However, there’s no indicator for when this is a placeholder and when there was actually one offender but whose demographic info is unknown.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.4</span> Which agencies report data</h2>
<p>So if this data has the same info (other than unfounded and negative crimes) as UCR data, but is also far more detailed, why do people ever use UCR data? Besides NIBRS being more complicated to use, far fewer agencies report NIBRS data than do UCR data. Nearly all agencies report crime data for UCR, though fewer do so for some of the UCR datasets such as arrests or arsons - for more, please see my <a href="https://ucrbook.com/">UCR book</a>. In comparison, fewer than half of agencies report to NIBRS, and these agencies are disproportionately smaller and more rural. Starting with 2021 data, the FBI has stopped collecting UCR data, instead only collecting NIBRS data. So if - and this is a very large if - agencies move to NIBRS in 2021, we’ll start having much more detail from a very representative sample of agencies.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a>. Even so, most research - especially policy analyses - requires many years of data so it’ll take many years before the full potential of NIBRS data can be realized, assuming most agencies report data starting in 2021.</p>
<p>We’ll look here at how many agencies report at least one crime between 1991 - the first year of data - and 2019 - the latest year of data - as well as compare NIBRS reporting to UCR reporting. Figure <a href="overview-of-the-data.html#fig:agenciesReporting">2.2</a> shows the number of agencies each year that reported at least one incident. Keep in mind that there are about 18,000 police agencies in the United States. Only a little over 600 agencies reporting in 1991. This has grown pretty linearly, adding a few hundred agencies each year though that trend accelerated in recent years. In 2019, nearly 8,200 agencies reported at least some data to NIBRS. Compared to the estimated 18,000 police agencies in the united States, however, this is This is an overcount, however, this constitutes relatively low participation among agencies. And, as agencies may report for part of the year meaning that we actually have fewer fully reporting agencies that this graph applies.</p>

<p>Another way to look at reporting is comparing it to reporting to UCR. Figure <a href="overview-of-the-data.html#fig:agenciesReportingMap">2.3</a> shows the number of agencies in each state that report NIBRS data in 2019. Since 2019 is the year with the most participation, this does overstate reporting for previous years. This map pretty closely follows a population map of the US. Texas had the most agencies, followed by Michigan and Ohio. The southern states have more agencies reporting than the lightly populated northern states. The issue here is that a number of states are in white, indicating that very few agencies reported. Indeed, four four of the most populated states - California, New York, Florida, and New Jersey - don’t have any agencies at all that report NIBRS data.</p>

<p class="caption">
Figure 2.3: The number of agencies in each state that reported at least one crime in 2019 to NIBRS.
</p>
</div>
<p>Since the number of agencies in a state is partially just a factor of population, Figure <a href="overview-of-the-data.html#fig:agenciesReportingMapPercent">2.4</a> shows each state as a percent of agencies in that state that report to NIBRS that also reported to the UCR Offenses Known and Clearances by Arrest (the “crime” dataset) in 2019. Not all agencies in the US reported to UCR in 2019 - and a small number reported to NIBRS but not UCR in 2019 - but this is a fairly good measure of reporting rates. Here the story looks a bit different than in the previous figure. Now we can tell that among north-western states and states along the Appalachian mountains, nearly all agencies report. In total, 18 states have 90% or more of agencies that reported to UCR in 2019 also reporting to NIBRS. Thirteen agencies have fewer than 10% of agencies reporting to NIBRS that also reported to UCR, with 5 of these having 0% of agencies reporting. The remaining states average about 56% of agencies reporting. So when using NIBRS data, keep in mind that you have very good coverage of certain states, and very poor coverage of other states. And the low - or no - reporting states are systematically high population states.</p>

<div id="how-to-identify-a-particular-agency-ori-codes" class="section level2" number="2.5">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.5</span> How to identify a particular agency (ORI codes)</h2>
<p>In the UCR and other FBI data sets, agencies are identified using <strong>OR</strong>iginating Agency <strong>I</strong>dentifiers or an ORI. An ORI is a unique ID code used to identify an agency.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> If we used the agency’s name we’d end up with some duplicates since there can be multiple agencies in the country (and in a state, those this is very rare) with the same name. For example, if you looked for the Philadelphia Police Department using the agency name, you’d find both the “Philadelphia Police Department” in Pennsylvania and the one in Mississippi. Each ORI is a 9-digit value starting with the state abbreviation (for some reason the FBI incorrectly puts the abbreviation for Nebraska as NB instead of NE) followed by 7 numbers. In the UCR data (another FBI data set) the ORI uses only a 7-digit code - with only the 5 numbers following the state abbreviation instead of 7. So the NIBRS ORI codes are sometimes called ORI9. For nearly all agencies, the only difference between the UCR ORI and the NIBRS ORI is that the NIBRS ORI has “00” at the end so it is technically 9 characters long but isn’t any more specific than the 7-character UCR ORI code.</p>
<p>When dealing with specific agencies, make sure to use the ORI rather than the agency name to avoid any mistakes. For an easy way to find the ORI number of an agency, use <a href="https://jacobdkaplan.com/crosswalk.html">this page</a> on my site. Type an agency name or an ORI code into the search section and it will return everything that is a match.</p>

<div id="the-data-as-you-get-it-from-the-fbi" class="section level2" number="2.6">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.6</span> The data as you get it from the FBI</h2>
<p>We’ll finish this overview of the NIBRS data by briefly talking about format of the data that is released by the FBI, before the processing done by myself or <a href="https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/pages/NACJD/index.html">NACJD</a> that converts the data to a type that software like R or Stata or Excel can understand. The FBI releases their data as fixed-width ASCII files which are basically just an Excel file but with all of the columns squished together. As an example, Figure <a href="overview-of-the-data.html#fig:ascii">2.6</a> shows what the data looks like as you receive it from the FBI for the 1991 NIBRS data, the first year with data available. The way the FBI releases NIBRS data adds even more complications to using ASCII files. Since there are multiple segments in each NIBRS file you’d think that each segment would be its own file. But, no, the FBI gives you a single file with every segment stacked on top of each other. And, it’s “stacked” essentially in a random way where row 1 may be from a certain segment while the next row is from a different segment.</p>
<p>You can think of this a little like chapters from a book. Normally chapter 1 is first, followed by chapter 2 and so on. And within each chapter are sentences that use proper punctuation so we can easily read it and know where one sentence ends and the next begins. The FBI’s NIBRS data basically removes all punctuation, cuts up every sentence and rearranges them in a random order and then hands it to you and says “read this.” This is a terrible way to present any data, but is what we’ve had every since data began in 1991 and seems highly unlikely to change.</p>
<p>The “fixed-width” part of the file type is how this works (the ASCII part basically means it’s a text file). Each row is the same width - literally the same number of characters, including blank spaces. Though each segment has a different width so you’ll first need to grab only the rows that correspond to a particular segment before you can read in that segment. So you must tell the software you are using to process this file - by literally writing code in something called a “setup file” but is basically just instructions for whatever software you use (R, SPSS, Stata, SAS can all do this) - which characters are certain columns. For example, in this data the first two character says which segment it is (07 means the Group B Arrestee segment) and the next two characters (in the setup file written as 3-4 since it is characters 3 through 4 [inclusive]) are the state number (01 is the state code for Alabama).<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> So we can read this row as the first column indicating it is an Group B Arrestee segment, the second column indicating that it is for the state of Alabama, and so on for each of the remaining columns. To read in this data you’ll need a setup file that covers every column in the data (some software, like R, can handle just reading in the specific columns you want and don’t need to include every column in the setup file).</p>

<p class="caption">

</p>
</div>
<p>The second important thing to know about reading in a fixed-width ASCII file is something called a “value label.”<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> For example, in the above image we saw the characters 3-4 is the state and in the row we have the value “01” which means that the state is “Alabama.” Since this type of data is trying to be as small as efficient as possible, it often replaces longer values with shorter one and provides a translation for the software to use to convert it to the proper value when reading it. “Alabama” is more characters than “01” so it saves space to say “01” and just replace that with “Alabama” later on. So “01” would be the “value” and “Alabama” would be the “label” that it changes to once read.</p>
<p>Fixed-width ASCII files may seem awful to you reading it today, and it is awful to use. But it appears to be an efficient way to store data back many decades ago when data releases began but now is extremely inefficient - in terms of speed, file size, ease of use - compared to modern software so I’m not sure why they <em>still</em> release data in this format. For you, however, the important part to understand is not how exactly to read this type of data, but to understand that people who made this data publicly available (such as myself and the team at NACJD) must make this conversion process.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> <strong>This conversion process, from fixed-width ASCII to a useful format is the most dangerous step taken in using this data - and one that is nearly entirely unseen by researchers.</strong></p>
<p>Every line of code you write (or, for SPSS users, click you make) invites the possibility of making a mistake.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> The FBI does not provide a setup file with the fixed-width ASCII data so to read in this data you need to make it yourself.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> Each NIBRS segment has over a dozen columns and potentially dozens on value labels.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> A typo anywhere could have potentially far-reaching consequences, so this is a crucial weak point in the data cleaning process - and one in which I have not seen anything written about before.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> While I have been diligent in checking the setup files and my code to seek out any issues - and I know that NACJD has a robust checking process for their own work - that doesn’t mean our work is perfect.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>

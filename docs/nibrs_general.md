# Overview of the Data



The average American had in 2019 about a 1 in 20,500 chance of being murder, 1 in 1,223 chance of being robbed, and a 1 in 64 chance of having something they own stolen. Getting these numbers is extremely simple. We take the number of crimes reported to the police and divide it by the number of people living in the United States that year. For example, there were about 16,000 murders in 2019 and 328 million people in the county - 16,000 / 328 million = ~1/20,500. You'll more commonly see this - in news articles, in political speeches, in research articles, on TV, etc. - reported as the rate per 100,000 people but that's just a matter of conversion, the numbers are the same. This is, however, totally wrong. It assumes - and let's now just pretend that there's no underreporting of crimes to the police - that every single person has the exact same risk of victimization. We know this is wrong intuitively. There are the "bad parts of town" or people who "run with the wrong crowd". Research in criminology backs this up by finding that crime is generally concentrated among a small group of people and within a small geographic area (usually a small number of streets or neighborhoods in a city). From surveys that ask if people have been victims of a crime we also know that victimization rates differ by age, race, gender, income, and city type. Indeed, think of a personal characteristic (e.g. risk tolerance, athleticism, frequency outdoors) and there will probably be large differences in the likelihood of being a victim within these groups.

So why do people so frequently talk about crime as rates per total population, why assume that everyone has equal risk of being a victim? 

## Choosing a unit of analysis

Given the detail of this data

Consider, for example, an incident where four men rape a single woman. If you're interested in measuring robbery you could do so in several different ways, each of which addresses a different part of crime measurement and will lead to different answers to your questions: the number of crime incidents, the number of victims, the number of offenders, and the number of crimes. . First, we can follow the old UCR measure of incident-level and say that this is one rape since only one crime incident occurred (even though there were multiple offenders). Second, we could look at the victim-level, which again is one rape as there was only one victim. Or at the offender-level, which now has four rapes since each offender would be responsible the robbery. Finally we could look at the offense-level.

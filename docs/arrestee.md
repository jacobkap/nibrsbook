### Arrest date

\begin{figure}

}

\caption{The distribution of the number of days from the incident to the arrest date. In 2019 the maxiumum days from incident to arrest was 461 days. Zero days means that the arrest occurred on the same day as the incident.}(\#fig:arrestsDaysUntilArrest)
\end{figure}


\begin{figure}

}

\caption{The number of days from the incident to the arrest date. Values over 10 days are grouped to better see the distribution for arrests that took fewer than 10 days. Zero days means that the arrest occurred on the same day as the incident.}(\#fig:arrestsDaysUntilArrestBarplot)
\end{figure}


### Weapons

All crimes can potentially have a weapon
